 # About project

 A React.js weather project is a simple web application that allows users to get real-time weather information. This project uses the power of React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, along with the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides weather data from around the globe.

In this project, the main component is WeatherApp. This component maintains two pieces of state: city and weather. The city state is used to store the name of the city entered by the user, and the weather state is used to store the weather data fetched from the API.

The fetchWeather function is an asynchronous function that is triggered when the form is submitted. It sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and your API key. The weather data returned by the API is then stored in the weather state.

# features 

 1 > Real-time Weather Information: The application fetches real-time weather data for any city entered by the user.
 2 > User-friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input the name of a city and get the current weather conditions.
 3 > API Integration: The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
 4 > Display of Weather Data: The application displays key weather parameters such as temperature and weather conditions (like clear sky, rain, etc.).
 5 > React.js Utilization: The application leverages key React.js concepts such as components, state, props, and hooks.
 6 > Asynchronous API Calls: The application uses asynchronous API calls to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
 7 > Error Handling: The application handles potential errors, such as when a user enters a city name that doesnâ€™t exist.
